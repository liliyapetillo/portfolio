# Liliya Vovk

Welcome to My Portfolio

Hello and welcome! I’m Liliya, a self-motivated and dynamic Senior Quality Assurance Engineer with a passion for e-commerce applications and extensive knowledge of software testing types and quality assurance methodologies. With over 7 years of experience, I’ve honed my skills in ensuring that software products meet the highest standards of quality.

I’m detail-oriented and thrive in managing multiple projects simultaneously while collaborating effectively with cross-functional teams in an Agile environment. My journey in QA has been marked by a commitment to excellence, a love for problem-solving, and a strong belief in the power of teamwork.

As a proven leader, I bring strong communication, time management, and delegation skills to every project I undertake. In this portfolio, you’ll find a curated selection of my work that highlights my expertise in test automation, manual testing, performance testing, and more.
